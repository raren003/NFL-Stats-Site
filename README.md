# Nfl Stats Site Project

## Custom in memory data store with client-server architecture Project - Team 42

Originally created as project for CS180 - Intro to Software Engineering course at University of California Riverside.

#### This README primarily focuses on the contributions made by Robert Arenas (myself).

We are using Django as the general framework for our web application. 

Upon cloning our repository, you should navigate to our application's "outer" directory (nfl_site) and run the following 
command:
```{python}
python manage.py runserver
```
This will host our web application on your local machine on a local port (default to 8000)
