# CS180 Project - Team 42
## Custom in memory data store with client-server architecture

We are using Django as the general framework for our web application. 

Upon cloning our repository, you should navigate to our application's "outer" directory (nfl_site) and run the following command:
```{python}
python manage.py runserver
```
This will host our web application on your local machine on a local port (default to 8000)
