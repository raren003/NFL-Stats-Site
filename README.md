## General Info

Originally created as project for CS180 - Intro to Software Engineering course at University of California Riverside.

Project includes contributions from Robert Arenas, Eduardo Rocha, Kyle Dean, and Ford St. John under the group name 
Team 42.

The project involves the creation of an application utilizing a custom in memory data store in combination with a 
client-server architecture in order to display analytical data.

## Demo

## Technologies used

We are using Django as the general framework for our web application. 

## Setup

Upon cloning our repository, you should navigate to our application's "outer" directory (nfl_site) and run the following 
command:
```{python}
python manage.py runserver
```
This will host our web application on your local machine on a local port (default to 8000)
